# Life Simulator ðŸŒŒ  

[Live Demo](https://www.life-simulator.com) | [Portfolio](https://patricktaburet.com)  

## ðŸ“– Description  
**Life Simulator** is an interactive particle-based simulation inspired by molecular interactions in nature. Using customizable rules of attraction and repulsion, particles evolve and self-organize into dynamic patterns, similar to behaviors found in physics, chemistry, and biology.  

Built with **p5.js** for rendering visuals on an HTML canvas, **dat.GUI** for UI control, and **Shepherd.js** for an interactive tutorial, the app blends art and science into a creative playground for exploration.  

Users can adjust interaction rules, switch between different modes (like *Drawing Mode* and *Nexus Mode*), and even save their creations as images.
